TwitchIrcChat
=============

Irc Application built to work with Twitch tv chat

Yo this is a readme, how exciting.

So with the password you will have to go to http://twitchapps.com/tmi/ to get an oauth code to get that shit working.
If you try to connect without an oauth password it will yell at you and open up the page.
Don't worry it just checks if it contains oauth in the password!
